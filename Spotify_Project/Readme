Hey Kunal this side, 
This project is a music player (Client Side Application) which clones the spotify.com to some extent. You can add songs in your playlist folder they will automatically append in the playlist section.
Artist Section is using the popular artist folder to generate tiles, you can append to it but keep in mind the display image should be inside the artist folder.
There are two hamburgers, one to store playlist and other to store the nav content, adjusted dynamically.

VS code is adviced to use, and to run it on mobile Live server will work.
